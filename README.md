LIFE LESSONS 101 üéØ


A solution to life's deep mysteries


### Team Members

### Project Description
Life Lessons 101 is a fun, character-based AI chatbot that delivers step-by-step recipes, life advice, and absurd instructions from the perspective quirky characters like a Sweet Granny, Sigma Male, Drill Sergeant, Philosophical Stoner, and more.

It delivers one step at a time and waits for the user to type or click ‚ÄúDone ‚úÖ‚Äù before moving forward‚Äîjust like an eccentric personal coach. Users choose their character mentor and ask anything from "How do I make tea?" to "How do I survive Monday?"

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world overloaded with serious advice and logical instructions, there‚Äôs a gaping hole no one dared to address:
‚ÄúWhy isn't there a life coach who can teach you how to make tea like a drill sergeant, explain heartbreak like a depressed poet, or guide you through tying your shoelaces like a Zen monk?‚Äù

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
I created these characters!
